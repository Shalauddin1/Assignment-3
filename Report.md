### Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal 
activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take 
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech 
geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well 
they do it. 
In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 
participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 

### Install the Libraries
```r
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)
```
### Download the Data
```r
The training data for this project are available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
The test data are available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv
```
### Read the Data
After dowloading the data use read.csv to read the data.
```r
trainRaw <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testRaw <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
```
The training data set contains 19622 observations and 160 variables, while the testing data set contains 20 observations and 160 
variables

### Clean the Data
First, Remove the column that contain missing values
```r
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, colSums(is.na(trainRaw)) == 0] 
testRaw <- testRaw[, colSums(is.na(testRaw)) == 0] 
```
Again remove some column which is not important to predict
```r
classe <- trainRaw$classe
trainRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(trainRaw))
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, !trainRemove]
trainCleaned <- trainRaw[, sapply(trainRaw, is.numeric)]
trainCleaned$classe <- classe
testRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(testRaw))
testRaw <- testRaw[, !testRemove]
testCleaned <- testRaw[, sapply(testRaw, is.numeric)]
```
Now, the cleaned training data set contains 19622 observations and 53 variables, while the testing data set contains 20 
observations and 53 variables.

### Sclice the Data
Split the cleaned training set into a pure training data set (70%) and a validation data set (30%).
```r
set.seed(22519) 
inTrain <- createDataPartition(trainCleaned$classe, p=0.70, list=F)
trainData <- trainCleaned[inTrain, ]
testData <- trainCleaned[-inTrain, ]
```

### Data Modeling
Using Random Forest algorithm because it automatically selects important variables.Use 5-fold cross validation when applying the 
algorithm.
```r
controlRf <- trainControl(method="cv", 5)
modelRf <- train(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="rf", trControl=controlRf, ntree=250)
modelRf
```
```

## 
## Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using  the largest value.
## The final value used for the model was mtry = 27.
```
Estimate the performance of the model on the validation data set.
